# Problem 1

``` r
#Import Mr. Trash Wheel dataset 
Mr_Trash_Data = 
  read_excel("./HW2_datasets/Mr_Trash_Wheel.xlsx",
             range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(
    round(sports_balls, 
          digits = 0)))
```

``` r
#Import and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018
Precipitation_data_2017 =
  read_excel("./HW2_datasets/Mr_Trash_Wheel.xlsx",
             sheet = 4,
             cell_rows(3:14),
             col_names = c("Month", "Total_Precipitation")) %>%
  mutate(Year = 2017)

Precipitation_data_2018 =
  read_excel("./HW2_datasets/Mr_Trash_Wheel.xlsx",
             sheet = 3,
             cell_rows(3:9),
             col_names = c("Month", "Total_Precipitation")) %>%
  mutate(Year = 2018)

#Combine data sets
Precipitation_data_2017_and_2018 = 
  bind_rows(Precipitation_data_2017, Precipitation_data_2018) %>%
  mutate(Month = month.name[Month]) %>%
  select(Year, Month, Total_Precipitation, everything())
```

`Mr_Trash_Data` has 285 observations and 14 variables:

  - Dumpster number
  - Month
  - Year
  - Date of dumpster check (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Weight (in tons) and volume (in cubic yards) of trash in dumpster
  - Quantity of plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass
    bottles, grocery bags, chip bags, and sports balls found in the
    dumpster
  - Number of homes powered (each ton of trash equates to on average 500
    kilowatts of electricity, and an average household will use 30
    kilowatts per day)

`Precipitation_data_2017_and_2018` has 19 observations and 3 variables:

  - Year
  - Month
  - Total Precipitation (in inches)

With the data available, the total precipitation in 2018 was 23.5
inches. In addition, the median number of sports balls found in the
dumpsters in 2017 was 8.

# Problem 2

``` r
#Import and clean pols-month dataset
Pols_month = 
  read_csv("./HW2_datasets/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.factor(month)]) %>%
  #In addition to 0s and 1s in the prez_gop variable, there are also 2s
  #All 2s will be considered as and reassigned to 1s
  mutate(prez_gop = ifelse(prez_gop == 1 | prez_gop == 2, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(president = recode(prez_gop, `0` = "dem", `1` = "gop")) %>%
  select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day))
```

``` r
#Import and clean snp dataset
snp =
  read_csv("./HW2_datasets/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  select(-day) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.factor(month)]) %>%
  select(year, month, everything())
```

``` r
#Import and clean unemployment dataset
unemployment_data = 
  read_csv("./HW2_datasets/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_percentage"
  ) %>%
  rename(year = Year) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.factor(month)]) %>%
  mutate(year = str_c(year))
```

``` r
#Merging all three datasets
snp_and_pols = left_join(Pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
snp_and_pols_and_unemployment = left_join(snp_and_pols, 
                                          unemployment_data, 
                                          by = c("year", "month"))
```
