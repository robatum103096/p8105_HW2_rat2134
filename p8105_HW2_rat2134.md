`Mr_Trash_Data` has 344 observations and 14 variables:

  - Dumpster number (`dumpster`, numeric vector)
  - Month (`month`, character vector)
  - Year (`year`, numeric vector)
  - Date of dumpster check (`date`, POSIXct format of form YYYY-MM-DD,
    used to store dates)

    vector)
  - Volume (in cubic yards) of trash in dumpster (`volume_cubic_yards`,
    numeric vector)

    vector)
  - Number of chip bags found in dumpster (`chip_bags`, numeric vector)
  - Number of sports balls found in dumpster (`sports_balls`, integer
    vector)
  - Number of homes powered (`homes_powered`, numeric vector, *each ton
    of trash equates to on average 500 kilowatts of electricity and an
    average household will use 30 kilowatts per day*)

`Precipitation_data_2017_and_2018` has 24 observations and 3 variables:

  - Year (`Year`, numeric vector)
  - Month (`Month`, character vector)
  - Total Precipitation in inches (`Total_Precipitation`, numeric
    vector)

With the data available, the total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33
inches. In addition, the median number of sports balls found in the
dumpsters in 2017 was 8.

#Merging all three datasets
snp_and_pols = left_join(Pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month"))

snp_and_pols_and_unemployment = left_join(snp_and_pols, 
                                          unemployment_data, 
                                          by = c("year", "month"))
```

The `Pols_month` dataset contains 822 observations and 9 variables:

  - Year (`year`, character vector)
  - Month (`month`, character vector)
  - Number of republican governors (`gov_gop`, numeric vector)
  - Number of republican senators (`sen_gop`, numeric vector)
  - Number of republican representatives (`rep_gop`, numeric vector)
  - Number of democratic governors (`gov_dem`, numeric vector)
  - Number of democratic senators (`sen_dem`, numeric vector)
  - Number of democratic representatives (`rep_dem`, numeric vector)
  - The political party of the serving President (`president`, character
    vector)

This data is available from January 1947 to June 2015.

The `snp` dataset contains 787 observations and 3 variables:

  - Year (`year`, character vector)
  - Month (`month`, character vector)
  - The closing value of the S\&P stock index on the associated date
    (`close`, numeric vector)

This data is available from January 1950 to October 2015.

The `unemployment_data` dataset contains 816 observations and 3
variables:

  - Year (`year`, character vector)
  - Month (`month`, character vector)
  - Percentage of unemployment (`unemployment_percentage`, numeric
    vector)

This data is available from January 1948 to September 2015.

Lastly, the `snp_and_pols_and_unemployment` dataset (merged by year and
month) contains 822 observations and 11 variables. All the variables in
this combined dataset contain those in the `Pols_month`, `snp`, and
`unemployment_data` datasets. This data is available in different time
intervals for different variables, which explains why there are some
`NA` values.
